## Swagger Documentation
Each service provides interactive API documentation:
- Auth: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html
- Booking: http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html  
- Tickets: http://localhost:8083/swagger-ui.html
- Assignments: http://localhost:8084/swagger-ui.html

## Workflow Example
1. **Admin creates booking session** with target drivers and time windows
2. **Admin creates tickets** for the session with different zones  
3. **Driver books tickets** in their allowed zones during booking window
4. **Driver claims assignments** that match their booked ticket zones
5. **All operations generate Kafka events** for audit and notifications

## Testing
Use `test-assignment-apis.bat` to test the claim/unclaim functionality.
